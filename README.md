2) nesting an entire css library into an scss class ... to override styling of material UI;
<br/>Instead of using withStyles as suggested by the documentation.

3) launch agent is a process that runs when the computer turns back on or wakes from sleep.
<br/>Change the background of a computer to be a screensaver 
<br/>restarting with reboot wake from sleep or after the process it was spawning is quit/killed.
